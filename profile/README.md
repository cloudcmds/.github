## Hi there 👋

We are the creators of [cmds.dev](https://cmds.dev), a scripting, automation, and collaboration platform for software development teams. Our mission is to make software development in the cloud more fun, interactive, and efficient.

We open sourced our cloud-first scripting language Tamarin.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
